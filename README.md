# Google-Homepage
Cloning Google's homepage for HTML and CSS practice

This mini project, in which i cloned Google's homepage, was made in order to practice my HTML and CSS skills and further improbe my abilities.
The project only clones the appearence, and not the functionality.

<h2>Further Improvements</h2>
This project is nowhere near perfect, however, these changes could further help it there:

* Using more Flexbox
* Using SVG icons
* Cleaner code
